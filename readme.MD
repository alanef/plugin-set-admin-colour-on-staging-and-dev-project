This plugin comes with two custom admin colours, Neon Pink ( you will ned sunglasses ) and Material, if the custom colours are are selected they also shown on the customizer and the adminbar on front end view.

## Frequently Asked Questions

+ Are there any settings? 

Dashboard>Settings>Staging Colours  but please note, to keep things tidy the setting page is not displayed on production sites ( as it adds no value and hence is just clutter )

Yes - go to Dashboard>Settings>Staging Colours

+ Can I change what is recognized as a dev or staging domain? 

Yes - go to Dashboard>Settings>Staging Colours

+ I changed the settings for domain selection and now nothing shows 

If you change the domain regular expressions and make a mistake and nothing shows becaus ethe plugin 'thinks' your domain is live - simply deactivate, delete and re-install the plugin. this will reset the expressions
